app:
This folder seems like the main “brain” of my Laravel app. I see controllers and models here. I guess this is where most of the actual app code lives.

routes:
Looks like this is where I tell Laravel what should happen for each website link. So if someone visits a certain URL, the matching file here decides what to show.

resources/views:
These are like the pages of my site. They have HTML but also some special Laravel stuff called Blade. This is probably where I’ll design how things look.

public:
This feels like the only part people on the internet can actually see. It has images, CSS, JavaScript, and an `index.php` file that starts everything.

database:
Here are files for creating and filling the database. There are “migrations” for making tables and “seeders”  for inserting dummy data.

config:
These files are packed with settings for the app, like specifying the database name or choosing the time zone. Kind of like the app’s control panel.
